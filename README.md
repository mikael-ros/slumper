3. Add an issue for your chapter, **create a development branch** and switch to it
4. In the branch, **change [``src/content/tasks/generatebook.ts``](src/content/tasks/generatebook.ts) to match your book**
5. **Generate the JSON** by, while in the ``src/content/tasks`` directory, running the ``./generatebook`` script (you might need to run ``chmod u+x generatebook.sh`` first)
6. Add the entry in [``src/scripts/random.ts``](src/scripts/random.ts), by importing it, creating a ``Book`` object and registering it in the list.
7. Push it and submit a **pull request**
