# 🎲 Slumper

***A web tool for randomizing and gameifying course exercises.***

🎰 **Randomizer** :: A smart randomizer that can save completed tasks and avoid them

⚙️ **Filters** :: Lets you filter chapters you want included

⏱️ **Timer** :: Allows you to time your performance, and set max time goals

## 🔨 Usage

Simply visit [slumper.me](https://www.slumper.me) and pick any of the pregenerated books, or add your own.

### 🎰 Randomization
To randomize, simply hit the random button!
### ⚙️ Filters
Select the chapters by checking the boxes
### ⏱️ Timer
Start the timer, stop it when finished. If you've set a maximum, and you hit it, a bell will ring.
### 📚 Adding books
Click the ``+`` button next to the book selector. It will bring you to a different page where you can add the chapters of the book, or import a previously generated book.

#### 🚤 Simple
In this mode, you only add the amount of tasks in each chapter and titles get autogenerated as "Chapter <x>". This makes book generation faster, but less detailed.

#### 🛶 Detailed
In this mode you can also assign a name to each chapter.

When all entries have been added, simply press ``Generate`` and the book will be added to your local browser storage. You can also choose to save the book to disk.

#### ✉️ Submitting a book to the default list
> [!NOTE]
> As per contact with the Swedish patent office [(PRV)](https://www.prv.se/sv/), it seems like I have to ask permossion for every book added, hence why adding books wont be as simple as pull requests.

To submit a book to be considered as a default:
1. Check the banned books list, to see if it's banned
2. If not banned, submit an issue with the tag ``book`` and title as the book title. The description should contain the ISBN.

I will, given time, then contact the copyright holder myself and seek permission, and will respond wheter or not it got approved or not. If approved,I will ask you to provide the generated book. If the copyright holders decline, it will go in the banned books list.

#### ‼️ Troubleshooting
- 📤 ``"I tried to import a previously generated book, but it gave me an error"``: It is possible that the program has changed inbetween, which will unfortunately mean you have to regenerate the book.

## 📚 Banned books 🚫
What follows is a list of books that will never be added to the default list of books, and the reason why. You can, however, add these yourself locally; I simply cannot, due to copyright issues, include them in the default list.

| Book title | Author(s) | Reason |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| Linjär algebra övningsbok | Jonas Månsson, Patrik Nordbeck | Declined by Månsson |
