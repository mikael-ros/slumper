## 📚 Hall of shame
What follows is a list of books that will never be added to the default list of books, and the reason why.

_The shame here is not to the authors, but to the fact it couldn't be included_

| Book title | Author(s) | Reason |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| Linjär algebra övningsbok | Jonas Månsson, Patrik Nordbeck | Declined by author |
