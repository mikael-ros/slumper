# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest build, the one provided on the website, is provided security updates. If using a local version, always update to the latest version, or atleast run ``npm audit``.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, please report it by contacting the repository admin in private, hello.embracket@gmail.com. This is preferable, since it keeps the impact from being broad.
